Cliche Command-Line Shell
=========================

Release 1 (Jan 09, 2009)
------------------------

### Summary

This is the first official release. All functionality is tested, not as thoroughly as should be, but I do use Cliche in a couple of projects, so quality seems to be acceptable :)

### What's inside

This release includes Cliche jar (built for JRE 1.6), full source code and some documentation (javadocs included), that you can also find at [Cliche home page](/) (you've been there, aren't you?).
